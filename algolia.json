CV After graduating Graduate School of Science, Nagoya University, JAPAN, he entered master’s degree course in Nagoya University and took master’s degree. After that, he started working at RIKEN then Nagahama Institute of Bio-Science and Technology. At RIKEN, he contributed several projects about Arabidopsis full-length cDNAs and functional genomics (Yamada et al. Science 2002, IIDA et al. DNA Res. 2005). During these periods, he found environment-responding changes of alternative splicing profiles in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant, and found extremely conserved alternative splicing events on SR protein genes among land plants from moss to flowering plant for more than 400 million years (IIDA et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004, IIDA and GO Mol. Biol. Evol. 2006). With these studies, he got Ph.D. at Nagoya University.\nWhen he was a postdoctoral researcher of Prof. Jian-Kang Zhu laboratory in University California, Riverside, he joined a research project to clear out methylation and demethylation regulation of plant genomes via small RNAs (Zheng et al. Nature 2008). He also started researched with High- Throughput Sequencer (HTS, or Next-Generation Sequencer; NGS). He focused of the differences between cDNA sequences from HTS and genomic sequences, called RNA-DNA Differences (RDD), and found that several RDDs reflected RNA-base modification, especially for tRNAs, rRNA, and putatively for micro RNAs (IIDA et al. BMC Genomics 2009).\nWhen he returned to Japan in 2008, we joined Tetsuro Toyoda group at RIKEN. With collaboration with Shuji Kawaguchi, he developed a method for detecting alternatively spliced regions of mRNAs using tiling array or HTS outputs, without prior information of gene annotations (Kawaguchi et al. Bioinformatics 2012, IIDA et al, Plant Cell Physiol. 2011). With this method, he contributed on FANTOM5 project …","date":-62135596800,"description":"","objectID":"cb267dd168b340839fbe2a2a0163005b","permalink":"https://keiiida.github.io/about_me/","title":"About Me"},{"content":"Just for test.\n","date":-62135596800,"description":"","objectID":"bd5e63eca597837169d409af03845074","permalink":"https://keiiida.github.io/posts/2020_0625_post/","title":"test post"},{"content":"","date":-62135596800,"description":"","objectID":"a74dbcb35ee06db2c5314e7ff0d9268f","permalink":"https://keiiida.github.io/posts/","title":"Posts"},{"content":" Splicing Regulation RNA-binding Proteins Epi-Transcriptomics Plant Functional Genomics  ","date":-62135596800,"description":"","objectID":"bc8c75ec10f4acb491c3299f2f23af66","permalink":"https://keiiida.github.io/research/","title":"Research Projects"},{"content":" We are ready for supporting bioinformatics analysis,\nespecially for RNA-seq, CLIP-seq, and other transcrptome studies.
